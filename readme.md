# Building an app with .net core and react

### Part 2: The walking skeleton
A walking skeleton is a tiny implementation of the system that performs a small end-to-end function that links together the main architectural components. The architecture and functionality can then evolve in parrallel. 

This module will include: 
- clean architecture
- using dotnet cli
- reviewing project templates
- running the app
- EF migrations (scaffold database from our code and auto-create it, "entity-framework migration")
- seeding data
- postman
- using git for source control
